            <li>First we have to prepare our salad. Chop some green onions and mix them with coleslaw mix and mayo.</li>
            <li>Next we are going to make a flavor bomb sauce. Into the samll bowl pour few drops of soy sauce, couple table spoons mayo and one tea spoon siracha. Mix it well and we it's done.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper our meat and form into the two equal balls. Then put them onto the hot nonsticking pan and smash them down to make our patties. Fry even on the bouth sides and once it's done cover them with aluminium foil for few minutes. </li>
            <li>Cut in half the bun and place the pieces on the same pan insides down. Roast them to the golden bron and tak out quickly.</li>
            <li>Since everything is good to go we can start building our masterpiece. Place down your bun and cover it with preppared sauce. Then place one patty and salad. Another patty and more salad. And last but not least cover the burger with bun but consider puting onto more sauce. </li>
            <li>Good job! Enjoy your meal it's ready to be eaten.</li>
